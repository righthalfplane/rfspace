* Freescale i.MX System Controller Watchdog

i.MX system controller watchdog is for i.MX SoCs with system controller inside,
the watchdog is managed by system controller, users can ONLY communicate with
system controller from secure mode for watchdog operations, so Linux i.MX system
controller watchdog driver will call ARM SMC API and trap into ARM-Trusted-Firmware
for watchdog operations, ARM-Trusted-Firmware is running at secure EL3 mode and
it will request system controller to execute the watchdog operation passed from
Linux kernel.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be :
		"fsl,imx8qxp-sc-wdt"
		followed by "fsl,imx-sc-wdt";

Optional properties:
- timeout-sec : Contains the watchdog timeout in seconds.

Examples:

watchdog {
	compatible = "fsl,imx8qxp-sc-wdt", "fsl,imx-sc-wdt";
	timeout-sec = <60>;
};
